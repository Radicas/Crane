# Scarab

In our daily work, we are often faced with the problem of equipment replacement. 
It takes several hours or even half a day to configure the development environment each time you switch devices. 
This project lists commonly used software, tools, and corresponding installation methods. 
Some one-click configuration scripts are also provided if necessary.
About why the project was named Scarab, because recently I was infatuated with the unicorn fairy and wanted to keep a 
unicorn fairy as a pet. But the English name of the unicorn fairy is not very good, so I think of the scarab.

日常工作中，我们经常面临设备更换的问题。每次切换设备，需要花几个小时甚至半天时间配置开发环境。
本项目会列出常用的软件、工具，以及对应的安装方法。必要时也会提供一些一键配置脚本。
关于为什么项目要命名为Scarab，因为最近我迷上了独角仙，想养一只独角仙当宠物。但是独角仙的英文名不是很好听，于是联想到了圣甲虫。
